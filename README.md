# Hello! üëã

Welcome to my Github profile! I hope you will find the projects I am working on interesting, whether you are a recruiter, a friend or just curious.
As a programmer I would describe myself as a full-stack (backend-leaning) Web Developer with a strong background in WordPress, and with aspirations in other areas of tech - game development in particular.

For my half-personal-half-professional blog, you can check it here:  [0395.ch](https://0395.ch)

My LinkedIn is available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/estev%C3%A3o-n-456aa91a9/). I also have a github.io page here: - [estevaojneto.github.io](estevaojneto.github.io) -> this one is somewhat out of date, but updating it is on my bucket list :)
